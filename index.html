          Hey! My name is Alonso, I make web applications for a living and also do game development and design on my
          free time. I've finished my degree on IT and game development back on 2015. After that, I worked as a game
          designer on a game development studio, a junior developer and temporal manager at a web development
          company.</br>
          Now I'm currently coursing a web development bootcamp where I'm aiming to get a job as a front-end developer.
